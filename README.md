## What Is This?

**This is a FRAMEWORK, not an implementation.** 

The Telecom ML Framework provides:

✅ **6 Production-Ready ML Project Templates** covering the most common telecom AI/ML use cases  
✅ **Complete Technical Specifications** with problem framing, data requirements, and model architectures  
✅ **Domain-Informed Data Generators** embedding real telecom physics (SINR, QoE, congestion patterns)  
✅ **Unified Technical Standards** ensuring consistency across projects (dependencies, plotting, interpretability)  
✅ **Portfolio Documentation** demonstrating domain expertise and ML problem-solving approach

**What this is NOT:**
- ❌ Not a trained model or production system
- ❌ Not a Python package to install via pip
- ❌ Not a data science library with APIs

This framework serves as both a **project template generator** for rapid ML project creation and a **portfolio documentation hub** showcasing telecom domain expertise applied to ML.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Method 1: Manual Template Copy (Recommended for Learning)

```bash
# 1. Copy the template directory
cp -r template/ ../my-churn-prediction
cd ../my-churn-prediction

# 2. Customize the project
# - Rename src/__project_name__/ to your project name
# - Update pyproject.toml with your details
# - Customize data_generator.py for your use case

# 3. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 4. Generate synthetic data
uv run python -m your_project_name.data_generator

# 5. Start working!
uv run jupyter lab notebooks/
```

### Method 2: Using the Example Script (Automated)

```bash
# Create a new project from template
python examples/create_project.py \
  --name churn-prediction \
  --use-case UC1 \
  --output ../my-projects/

cd ../my-projects/churn-prediction
uv sync
uv run python -m churn_prediction.data_generator
```

### Next Steps

1. **Read the documentation**: Start with [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)
2. **Choose a use case**: Review [USE_CASES.md](docs/USE_CASES.md) to select your focus
3. **Customize the template**: Adapt data generation and features to your needs
4. **Build your portfolio**: Each project becomes a standalone repository

## Philosophy

### Domain Expertise Over Code Complexity

This framework emphasizes:

✅ **Problem Framing** - Translating business problems into well-defined ML tasks  
✅ **Domain Knowledge** - Embedding telecom physics in data and features  
✅ **Interpretability** - SHAP explanations for business stakeholders  
✅ **Practical Solutions** - Fit-for-purpose algorithms, not bleeding-edge research  
✅ **End-to-End Thinking** - Data → Features → Model → Insights → Impact

### Why Synthetic Data?

Production telecom data is proprietary and sensitive. Instead of using off-the-shelf synthetic data tools, this framework provides **hand-crafted data generators** that:

- Embed real telecom physics (SINR, Shannon capacity, congestion patterns)
- Control data quality and realism (class imbalance, temporal patterns)
- Maintain interpretability (every data point has a clear causal story)
- Demonstrate domain expertise in how signals propagate and networks behave

### Technical Standards

All templates enforce:
- **Python 3.11+** for modern language features
- **uv** for fast, deterministic dependency management
- **SHAP-compatible versions**: `numpy<2.0`, `xgboost<2.0`, `numba>=0.59.0`
- **Unified plotting**: Seaborn with context switching (notebook vs presentation)
- **Testing**: pytest for data quality and pipeline validation
- **Linting**: Ruff for code quality
